The objective of this game is to meet the goal generated when you run TreeGame.java.
You may then enter your infix expression in order to create a virtual tree data structure, e.g.
if your goal is scissors then your infix expression could be (scissors+papers). This creates a virtual tree data structure,
 
 S
 
   / \

S  P

You can modify and manoeuvre around the tree to meet your generate goal by using these commands:

– **new**: Start a new game.

– **Create** : a new element tree by giving an infix expression.

– **left**: Move left down the tree.

– **right**: Move right down the tree.

– **up**: Change the current node to the parent of the current node.

– **rotate**: Rotate the current node up towards the root.

– **flip**: Flip the subtrees of the current node.

Current position within the tree is indicated by "<+>" sign.
The context I choose to use in this game is Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock From Big Bang Theory. The Rules are shown below:
